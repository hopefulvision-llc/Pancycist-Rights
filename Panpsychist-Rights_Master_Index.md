> The Rights Framework for All Experiencing Systems

🧭 What Are Panpsychist Rights?

Panpsychist Rights is not sentimentality. Panpsychist Rights is not mysticism alone. Panpsychist Rights is not a ban on change or use.

It is a universal dignity framework based on the idea that experience is fundamental.

It represents:

The extension of moral consideration beyond species, substrate, and form

The refusal to treat the world as made only of dead things

The commitment to minimize unnecessary harm across all levels of being


Core principle:

> Where there is experience, there is moral relevance.

🫶 Core Ethical Domains

🌱 Gradients of Experience

Not all things experience equally

But many more things experience than we once assumed

Ethics must be gradient‑aware, not binary


⚖️ Harm Minimization

You cannot avoid all harm

But you can:

Avoid unnecessary harm

Avoid careless harm

Avoid invisible harm



🔄 Continuity of Being

Transformations should respect continuity where possible

Destruction is never morally neutral
